# AdPredFlask
I have created a flask app which predicts chance of admission into university based on gre,toelf, and other academics scores. I am uploading ipython file for creating pickle file. Flask App code and html templates.  

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 

You can just download the code from gihub and run main.py file
Then in web browser go to your localhost with port 5000 or 8000.
