# AdPredFlask - University Admission Prediction Flask App


## Introduction

AdPredFlask is a Flask web application that predicts the chances of admission into a university based on GRE, TOEFL, and other academic scores. The app utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical admission data to provide accurate predictions.

## Installation and Usage

To run the AdPredFlask application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [AdPredFlask](https://github.com/your-username/AdPredFlask).

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt'''

Run the main.py file to start the Flask application:

```python main.py```

Access the application in your web browser by typing either localhost:5000 or localhost:8000 in the address bar.

## Usage Instructions
Once the AdPredFlask app is running, you will be directed to the home page.

Enter the required academic details, such as GRE score, TOEFL score, and other relevant information.

Click on the "Predict" button to get the prediction of your chances of admission.

The app will display the result, indicating the probability of admission to the university based on the provided information.


## How to Improve the App

I welcome contributions and suggestions to improve the AdPredFlask application. Here are a few ideas to enhance the project:

- Improve the user interface: Enhance the HTML templates and CSS styles to make the app more visually appealing and user-friendly.

- Add more features: Expand the application to include additional features, such as allowing users to upload their academic records in a CSV file.

- Model retraining: Periodically retrain the machine learning model with new data to improve prediction accuracy.

- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to provide meaningful messages to users in case of incorrect inputs or server issues.
